# Why go through the effort?

Honestly? I wasn't happy with Windows 10 UI/UX:

 - It was too cluttered
 - Inconsistent menu themes
 - Poor multi-tasking capabilities
 - Too many background processess I don't know about

# My new enviornment #

The main goal of this project was to create a minimal, personal environment that allowed me to be focused and productive, and I achieved just that.

- Aware of every process that is active, since I enabled the processes in the first place
- i3 tiling windows manager allows for effective use of screen space
- Assign custom key-binds for opening, reorganzing, and moving windows:
    - MOD + ENTER, opens terminal
    - MOD + SHIFT + ENTER, opens browser
    - MOD + SHIFT + Q, closes focused windows
    - MOD + R, resizes windows
